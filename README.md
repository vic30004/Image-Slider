# Image-Slider

A Simple image slider mini project. The app will take the pictures and create a slide show. The size of the of the slideshow will resize according to the size of the picture.

# Tech-Used 

I used Jupyter Notebook and Python for this project. 

# Modules
I used tkinter to create slideshow and to display the pictures.

I also used itertools to help iterate over the pictures. 

# Running project

In order to run the project, download or clone the the repo and you will need to run the app.py file. Jupyter notebook will not be able to run this project. I used VS Code to run the file but you are welcomed to use anyother IDE.
